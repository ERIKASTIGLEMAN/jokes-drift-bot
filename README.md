# Jokes Drift Bot

![SDG](./docs/button.png)

Technical Support Engineer Presentation

The Challenge:
During this time, we would love to hear more from you, and “see you in action.” We’d like to get a full understanding of how you manage clients, conduct product demonstrations, and articulate product value.

In this scenario, your customer is looking to implement a custom workflow which is not native to the Drift application. Specifically, your customer is trying to create a bot that can intelligently tell jokes to site visitors! To do this, they’ll need to use some APIs.

Your task is to create a presentation and demonstrate walking through how you would recommend implementing a joke bot (like the one shown here) to a customer using two APIs. You should also be able to clearly explain to the customer the time it will take them to build something like this on their end. Bonus points if you can implement your own and live demo it!

We would like to walk away from the meeting understanding your technical knowledge, as well as your ability to communicate that knowledge effectively to a non-technical person. Be prepared to explain, handle some objections, and otherwise treat this as a real client presentation or demonstration!

Accessing the Application
Navigate to https://app.drift.com/letsgo/start and create a new Drift account. This will give you the access you need to test / build via the API.

Preparing for Success:
Plan to present for 15-20 minutes. In addition to the prepared material, we’ll likely have around 10 minutes of Q&A throughout the presentation (our team will role play as your customer personas). We will reserve an hour in case there are additional questions at the end. If there are no additional questions, the team will debrief with you and we will end the call early. We are committed to you getting the context and guidance you need to shine.

Additional tips:
Review the Drift Developer Documentation
Review icanhazdadjoke API documentation
Develop a presentation to show during the interview walking through how you would recommend implementing a joke bot (like the one shown here - and in the .gif below) to a customer using these two APIs. You should also be able to clearly explain to the customer how
